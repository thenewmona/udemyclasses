/* Operators - Assign and compare values,perfoming arithmetic operations and more, allowing programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
They have binary, unary, and tunery operators

operand
binary has a operand - operator -operand (2 + 3;) 
unary  has a operand - operator (y++;)
Basic arithmetic operators (* /%+-)
var count = 10+5-4;//11
var mult = 3*5;//15
var div = 12/4;//3
var remainder = 21%4;//1(modulas operator give you the remainder of two values 
+ operater will also be used for string concatation 

arithmetic operators - 
assignment operators - assigns values to its left operand based on the value of it's right operand 
= is not asking if the operands are the same, instead is assigning the value of it's right operand to the left (x =14;)
var count =5;
(count = count + 4; count +=4;)
+ in front of the = will take the value of the variable which is 5 and add it to the 4


comparision operators - compare both sides of the equations. Return a logical value if it is true.
They can be numerical, string, logical, or object oriented

equality operators - 
== Equal value
=== Equal value and type 

var x =8;
var y ='8';
x == y; //true

concatenation operator = string
